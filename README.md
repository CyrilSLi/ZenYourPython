## What is this?
This website is meant to serve as a complete catalogue of pythonic idioms, or in other words, what makes pythonic code pythonic. 

Alexandru and some other researchers wrote a paper called [*On the Usage of Pythonic Idioms*](https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/alexandru/pythonic-onward-2018.pdf) where they conducted a literature review and interviews with experienced Python developers to define what pythonicity is and what the related idioms are. Their result was, as they say, an "inexhaustive list" of idioms.

Using grounded theory, I conducted a literature review of several Python books and also cross referenced it with the results they found, and this website is the result.

This website is part of my paper called *How To Zen Your Python*, my research project as part of the graduation phase from the University of Twente.
